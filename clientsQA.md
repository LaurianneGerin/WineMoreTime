**_Question 1: Hello,_**

**_I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:_**

**_Records_**
**_Indexing_**
**_I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."_**

**_Cheers, George_**

Hello George, 

Thanks for reaching out. Indexes are a collection of items. A record represents one of the items that you search on.
Imagine a restaurant menu. The whole list of dishes represents the collection of records, hence the index. A single dish is a record of the menu where you can find out what it is made of, i.e steak, beans, potatoes... These would be the attributes behind a record.
You can read more about it here https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/

The custom ranking settings depends on the item you want to put forward for a given business metrics. Imagine you search for a meal in the menu that has fish and vegetables. Two dishes appears in your results. You can chose for instance a popularity metrics as your custom ranking to make one of the two dishes more relevant to your customer. Or the price if you want to put forward the cheapest.

Hope your questions are answered.

Best regards,

**_Question 2: Hello,_**

**_Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient._**

**_Regards, Matt_**

Hello Matt, 

Thank you for your feedback. I am sorry to hear the new dashboard design displeases you. We want to build the best user experience and after many reviews, we decided that clearing and deleting indexes should take several safety steps.
If you need to iterate this process, you can take the search settings and make a script of your own using Aloglia' API: https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/clear-objects/ or https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/delete-index/.

Please feel free to let us know if you have any other feedback, happy to help.

Cheers,
